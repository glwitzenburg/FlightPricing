# FlightPricing

//Functionality && Goal -
The goal of this project is to find the flight prices everyday in the year and text them through twilio. The project is currently configured
to run Des Moines to Honolulu, but ideally I would like to make this more object oriented where the user can dynamically change
the origin and destination. Ideally it would also be good to implement a date range instead of running the whole year. 

//IDE && language
I programmed this in Java, with the IntelliJ IDE. There are a few jar files that will need to be imported (JSON parser, Twilio, and HTTP) 
in order for the program to run as intended.
